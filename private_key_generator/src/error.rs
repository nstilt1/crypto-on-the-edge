/// A validation error indicating that the ID was invalid.

    ///
    /// 1. (most likely) - someone tried to forge an ID
    /// 2. (still kind of likelyâ€”it depends on how you used this library) - the
    ///    ID may have been legitimately created by this program, but was
    ///    created using associated data such as a "Client ID," and when trying
    ///    to validate the ID's HMAC, no associated data was provided. This
    ///    would have resulted in a `BadHMAC` error.

    /// provide the Client ID when validating the ID.
